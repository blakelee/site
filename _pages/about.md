I'm an Android Software Engineer with industry experience dating back to 2017. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work at companies you might recognize — Redfin, Rover.com, and Square.

After some time in the field, I realized I enjoy building apps my own way. So I took the leap and started my own business.

This blog documents the challenges and insights that come with developing a greenfield app from the ground up — especially using Kotlin Multiplatform and Compose Multiplatform. Since my app targets both Android and iOS, I’m learning how to architect something scalable while working with technologies that are still rapidly evolving.
